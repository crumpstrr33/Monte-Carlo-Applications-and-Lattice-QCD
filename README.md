## Description
### Gluonic Path Integral
Measured three different Wilson loops using a second- and third-order correction Wilson action as described in the paper. The Wilson loops are:
- AxA
- Ax2A
- Ax3A

where A is the lattice spacing. The Wilson loops are approximated via Monte Carlo thus using a simple mean of the real traces of the loops.
